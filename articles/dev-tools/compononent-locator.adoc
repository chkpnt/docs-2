= Component Locator

You can use the component locator to identify components and to find their code when running applications in <<../configuration/development-mode#,development mode>>.
The component locator opens the corresponding source code in your IDE when you click a component, for example, a Button, in a view. 

== Enabling the Component Locator

Start by running your Vaadin application project in development mode. Click on the Vaadin symbol [guilabel]`}>` at the bottom right hand corner of your browser window. Go to the [guilabel]`Code` tab from the menu and click on [guilabel]`Find component in code` to initialize the Component Locator.

== Using the Component Locator

Hover your pointer over a component in your view to highlight in red and identify it. The component name appears in a list at the bottom right hand corner of your browser window and you can use your arrow keys to navigate between components in the list. Finally, click on the highlighted component to jump into the relevant source code in your IDE.
