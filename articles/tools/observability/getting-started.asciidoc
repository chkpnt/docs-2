= Getting Started with Observability Kit
:sectnums:

This guide covers the following topics:

- downloading Observability Kit, and configuring it to export data to the infrastructure;
- setting up infrastructure for collecting and viewing observability data, such as traces and metrics;
- running a Vaadin application with Observability Kit.
- adding frontend observability to the application.

== Download and Configure Observability Kit

Observability Kit is packaged as a Java agent based on the OpenTelemetry standard.
For more information, see <<{articles}/tools/observability/reference#,Reference>>.

link:https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/vaadin/observability/vaadin-opentelemetry-javaagent/1.0.0/vaadin-opentelemetry-javaagent-1.0.0.jar[Download Observability Kit, role="button secondary water"]

Next, Observability Kit needs to be configured to export traces to Jaeger, and metrics to Prometheus.
For this, create an [filename]`agent.properties` file with the following contents:

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=agent-properties]

== Setup Infrastructure

Use Jaeger to process traces and Prometheus to process metrics.
They both run locally and are suitable for development and testing.
For integration with other vendors, see <<{articles}/tools/observability/integrations#,Integrations>>.

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=jaeger-setup]

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=prometheus-setup]

== Run the Application

If you don't have an application to use, you can download an application from https://start.vaadin.com[Vaadin Start], and create a production build with the following command:

```terminal
./mvnw package -Pproduction
```

Then run the packaged JAR file from the [filename]`target` folder:

include::./integrations/_run-app.asciidoc[]

include::./integrations/jaeger-prometheus.asciidoc[tag=view-traces-metrics]

== Frontend Observability

Frontend Observability provides traces and spans containing information about operations that are initiated by the frontend of an application (at the browser).
For more information on the types of spans and attributes that are generated, see <<{articles}/tools/observability/reference#frontend-traces,Frontend Traces>>.

Frontend instrumentation is provided by a separate module dependency.

[NOTE]
The Observability Kit Agent is still required in order to view the frontend traces in an observability tool.

To get started, add Observability Kit as a dependency to the project:

.`pom.xml`
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
  <artifactId>observability-kit-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Clean, build and run your project.
There will now be frontend spans appearing in the observability tool you have configured.
